# Research Question

The aim of this analysis is to investigate diabetes prevalence over time. The analysis looks at the variables year, country and sex to identify groups with high diabetes prevalence. 

# Dataset Introduction 

The dataset ['DIABETES evolution of diabetes over time'](https://www.ncdrisc.org/data-downloads-diabetes.html) is a global dataset of diabetes prevelance from the years 1980 to 2014 and contains a total of 14,000 observations and 7 variables: 

- "Country/Region/World", 
  - *e.g. "Turkey",  "Bangladesh", "New Zealand"*
- "ISO", 
  - *A region code for international standard denominations for country subdivisions*
- "Sex", 
  - *Two factor variable "Men" or "Women"*
- "Year", 
  - *Ranges from 1980 to 2014*
- "Age-standardised diabetes prevalence", 
  - *Calculated as a percentage*
- "Lower 95% uncertainty interval" and 
- "Upper 95% uncertainty interval". 

**Table 2.1** below shows the first six observations of the full dataset. 


```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Read in Data 
data_full <- read_csv("Data/Diabetes_data.csv")

# create variable for first observations
data_full_head <- head(data_full)

# display in table
kable(data_full_head, 
             caption = "First Six Observations of the Full Diabetes Dataset",
             digits = 2)

```

# Dataset Description 

The full dataset was reduced to **1000** observations through a random generation of row numbers. The variable "ISO" was removed as it was not necessary for analysis. The reduced data has 6 variables (*Although the limit is 5 variables, I considered the lower and upper 95% confidence interval variables as one variable*). **Figure 3.1** below shows the code used to tidy the full dataset into the reduced dataset. 

```{r include = FALSE}
# Reduce size of Data 
set.seed(123)

data <- data_full[sample(nrow(data_full), 1000), ] 

data <- data %>%
  select("Country/Region/World", "Sex", "Year", "Age-standardised diabetes prevalence", "Lower 95% uncertainty interval", "Upper 95% uncertainty interval") %>%
  rename(diabetes_prevalence = `Age-standardised diabetes prevalence`, 
         lower_95 = `Lower 95% uncertainty interval`, 
         upper_95 = `Upper 95% uncertainty interval`)

```


```{r fig.cap="Code Screenshot of Data Tidying", fig.align="centre"}
include_graphics("Image/code_screenshot.png")
```

Using the function **str()** the first 2 rows of the data is displayed to show the type of variables in the data set (numeric, character/factor etc.).

```{r}
# first display only first 2 rows
head_data_2 <- head(data,2)

str(head_data_2)
```

# Data Summary {#table2}

Mean, median, standard deviation and the maximum/minimum were calculated for diabetes prevalence by "Year". **Table 4.1** shows the results of the summary statistics. *This section requires grouping by a factor/character variable. 'Year' is a numerical variable but was chosen here to better reflect the research question*. 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# group data by year and create summary statistics
data_summary <- data %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  summarise(mean_diabetes = mean(diabetes_prevalence), 
            median_diabetes = median(diabetes_prevalence),
            sd_diabetes = sd(diabetes_prevalence), 
            max_diabetes = max(diabetes_prevalence), 
            min_diabetes = min(diabetes_prevalence))
```

```{r}
# display only 10 observations (latest years)
tail_data_summary <- tail(data_summary, 10)

# create table
kable(tail_data_summary, 
             caption = "Mean and Standard Deviation of Diabetes Prevalence by Year (First 10 Rows)",
             digits = 3, 
      row_number(10))
```

From **Table 4.1** there does not appear to be a trend in mean diabetes prevalence from 2005 to 2014. **2011 had the highest mean** diabetes prevalence at 11.5% from the period 2005 to 2014, but also the **highest standard deviation**. The maximum global diabetes prevalence was recorded in 2006 and 2008 at 31.2%. The lowest minimum was recorded in 2014 at 3.2%. 

# Visualisations {#figure2}

## Diabetes Prevalence Over Time {#DPT}

A figure was created using the ggplot2 R package and the option geom_point(). This is displayed in **Figure 5.1:**

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.cap="Mean Diabetes Prevalence from 1980 to 2014", fig.align='center'}

Figure_2 <- ggplot(data = data_summary, aes(x = Year, y = mean_diabetes)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) + 
  xlab("Year") + 
  ylab("Mean Diabetes Prevalence") + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  labs(title = "Mean Diabetes Prevalence Increases Over Time", subtitle = "Red Bars Represent Standard Deviation", caption = " geom_smooth using method 'loess' and formula 'y ~ x' ") +
  geom_smooth() + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=mean_diabetes-sd_diabetes, ymax=mean_diabetes+sd_diabetes), colour="red", alpha=0.3)

Figure_2
```


- *There is a slight increase in mean diabetes prevalence from 1980 to 2014*
- *The standard deviation bars indicate a high dispersion of data* 

    
## Australian Diabetes Trends By Sex {#figure3}

```{r figure3, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.cap="Australian Diabetes Prevalence from 1980-2014", fig.align='center'}

# first filter for australian data
Australia_summary <- data_full %>%
  filter(`Country/Region/World` == "Australia")

Figure_3 <- ggplot(data = Australia_summary, aes(x = Year, y = `Age-standardised diabetes prevalence`, col = Sex)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.8) + 
  xlab("Year") + 
  ylab("Mean Diabetes Prevalence") + 
  labs(title = "Men have Higher Risk of Diabetes", subtitle = "Mean Diabetes Prevalence Has Increased Over Time", caption = "geom_smooth using method 'loess' and formula = 'y ~ x' ") +
  theme_minimal() + 
  geom_smooth()

Figure_3

```

Figure 5.2 shows a trend of increasing mean diabates prevalence over time. Men have a noticeably higher mean than women. There is a steep increase from 1980 to 2000 and then a plateau. Data was only available up to 2014. It is unknown whether the plateua begins to trend downwards. 


## Mean Diabetes Prevalence by Country {#table3}

```{r table3 }
# group by country and rank means 
data_country <- data_full %>%
  group_by(`Country/Region/World`) %>%
  summarise(mean_diabetes = mean(`Age-standardised diabetes prevalence`)) %>%
  arrange(desc(mean_diabetes))

# Create variable for first 10 rows 
data_country_10 <- head(data_country,10)


# create table
kable(data_country_10, 
             caption = "Top 10 Mean Diabetes Prevalence by Country",
             digits = 3, 
      row_number(10))
```

Each country was grouped to produce a mean diabetes prevalence and then were ranked to identify the top 10 countries. These countries include Nauru, American Samoa, Cook Islands, Palau, Niue, Tokelau, Tuvalu, French Polynesia, Marshall Islands and Tonga. The mean diabetes prevalence from 1980-2014 for these countries range from 16.2% to 28.7%. These countries/regions are located in the South Pacific and all have high risk of diabetes. 

# Conclusions 

- When grouping diabetes prevalence by year, mean diabates prevalence does not show a clear trend \@ref(figure2). 
  - There are many fluctuations over years. 
  - without grouping by country or sex, it is difficult to determine years with high diabetes prevalence. 
- 2011 has the highest diabetes prevalence, whereas 2014 has the lowest for the period 2005-2014 \@ref(table2). 
  - When comparing to the median, 2005 had the highest median diabetes prevalence and 2012 had the lowest. 
  - The standard deviations for each year are high indicating a high dispersion of data. 
- The results for diabetes prevalence over time were calculated from only 1000 entries of a full dataset containing 14,000 entries. \@ref(DPT) 
    - Possible error could be due to the random generation of rows and skew results. 
- Australian men have a higher mean diabetes prevalence than women \@ref(figure3)
- The global data indicates that Nauru had the highest mean diabetes prevalence for the period 1980-2014 \@ref(table3). 
  - South Pacific islands indicate high risk of diabetes prevalence. 
- Diabetes can cause life-threatening health complications, therefore identifying high prevalence groups can aid in prevention and treatment.
